# Bluetooth-Controlled-Robot-Car-BY-USING-ESP32
This project presents a Bluetooth-controlled robot car using the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 receives wireless commands via a smartphone and controls the motors through a driver circuit to navigate the car in different directions. It highlights the use of embedded systems and Bluetooth communication in robotics applications.
